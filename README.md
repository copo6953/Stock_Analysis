# Stock_Analysis
## Overview
* For this project I helped my good friend Steve analyze potential alternative energy investments using VBA. These alternative energy stocks will be used to diversify Steve's parents portfolio. My goal was to create a reusable macro tool that Steve can continue to use not only for this project, but for future projects as well.
## Results
* In 2017 every stock that was analyzed had a positive return other than TERP.

* In 2018 every stock other than ENPH and RUN had negative returns.

* Based on these relults it can be concluded that a majority of the stocks we investigated performed better in 2017 than in 2018.
* Refactoring the code resulted in faster execution times than the original script.

### Summary
* An advantage of refactoring code is that you already have a template to work with and you don't have to start from scratch. A disadvantage of refactoring code could be if you are working with code that was originally scripted by someone else, and this other person did not leave comments. Without comments it can be difficult to figure out what certain segments of code are intended to accomplish, or what certain variables are meant to represent.
* The refactoring of the original VBA script was much easier to complete because a majority of the code was a reusable template that carried over. It was also much easier because the refactoring starter code came equiped with comments that made it clear what each code segments purpose was.
