# Stock_Analysis
## Overview
* For this project I helped my good friend Steve analyze potential alternative energy investments using VBA. These alternative energy stocks will be used to diversify Steve's parents portfolio. My goal was to create a reusable macro tool that Steve can continue to use not only for this project, but for future projects as well.
## Results
* In 2017 every stock that was analyzed had a positive return other than TERP.
